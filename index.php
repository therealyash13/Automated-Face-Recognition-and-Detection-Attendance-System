          <p>Exam Hall Seating Allotment System is developed for the college to simplify examination hall allotment and seating arrangement.

          <p>n todayâ€™s world, everybody has a unique
identity, which is their face. The face or as in facial features
cannot be copied or replicated. In schools and colleges, time
is of the essence. Teachers and professors cannot waste their
time in taking attendance as they can be doing something
productive in that time. One period is of usually 50 minutes
to 1 hour, where 10 to 15 minutes are wasted in the process
of taking attendance. In the traditional method, a teacher
manually takes attendance, which takes up a lot of time as
human interaction is required at both ends. For every tutor,
this is a wastage of time. So to avoid these drawbacks, an
automatic process will be used in this project, which is based
on image processing. In this project, face detection and
recognition are used in a group to save time. Face detection
is used to locate human faces in a group, and face
recognition is used to recognize their faces. The attendance
of all the students in the class is stored in a database. When
the front face of the individual student matches one of the
faces stored in the database, then the attendance is marked,
present for all available students in the class, and absent in
other cases</p>
